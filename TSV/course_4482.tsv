Digital Information and Media Management - MSc (2 years distance learning)	Aberystwyth University	Information Studies		This MA course is identical to the 5-year version (P124D) but is for those students in receipt of the UK Government Loan only.Â The pace of progress is more intense to satisfy the regulations of the UK Government Loan. If you are not planning to fund your studies through such a loan we recommend applying for P124D, which can be undertaken flexibly over 2-5 years and allows more time for a better work/life balance.	September, April	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.
