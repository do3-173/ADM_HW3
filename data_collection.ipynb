    "\n",
    "For this homework, there is no provided dataset. Instead, you have to build your own. Your search engine will run on text documents. So, here\n",
    "we detail the procedure to follow for the data collection. We strongly suggest you work on different modules when implementing the required functions. For example, you may have a ```crawler.py``` module, a ```parser.py``` module, and a ```engine.py``` module: this is a good practice that improves readability in reporting and efficiency in deploying the code. Be careful; you are likely dealing with exceptions and other possible issues! \n",

    "### 1.1. Get the list of master's degree courses\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the list of courses to include in your corpus of documents. In particular, we focus on web scrapping the [MSc Degrees](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/msc-degrees/). Next, we want you to **collect the URL** associated with each site in the list from the previously collected list.\n",
    "The list is long and split into many pages. Therefore, we ask you to retrieve only the URLs of the places listed in **the first 400 pages** (each page has 15 courses, so you will end up with 6000 unique master's degree URLs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this step is a `.txt` file whose single line corresponds to the master's URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Crawl master's degree pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get all the URLs in the first 400 pages of the list, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the HTML corresponding to each of the collected URLs.\n",
    "2. After you collect a single page, immediately save its `HTML` in a file. In this way, if your program stops for any reason, you will not lose the data collected up to the stopping point.\n",
    "3. Organize the downloaded `HTML` pages into folders. Each folder will contain the `HTML` of the courses on page 1, page 2, ... of the list of master's programs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "__Tip__: Due to the large number of pages you should download, you can use some methods that can help you shorten the time. If you employed a particular process or approach, kindly describe it.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, you should have all the HTML documents about the master's degree of interest, and you can start to extract specific information. The list of the information we desire for each course and their format is as follows:\n",
