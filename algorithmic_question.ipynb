    "## 7. Algorithmic Question \n",
    "Leonardo is an intern at a company. He is paid based on the total number of hours he has worked. They agreed __d__ days ago that Leonardo could not work less than $minTime_i$ or more than $maxTime_i$ hours per <ins>i-th</ins> day. Furthermore, he was warned by HR that on his last day at the company, he should provide a detailed report on how many hours he worked <ins>each day</ins> for the previous d days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is the day Leonardo should report to HR, but the problem is that he <ins>didn't</ins> account for how many hours he put in for each day, so he only has the __total sum of the hours__ ($sumHours$) he put in total in these d days. He believes that if he creates a report in which each number $dayHours_i$ corresponds to the __total hours he worked on the i-th day__ while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all $dayHours_i$ equals $sumHours$, he would be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He cannot create such a report independently and requests your assistance. He will give you the number of days $d$, total hours spent $sumHours$, and the HR limitations for each day $i$, and he wants you to assist him in determining whether it is possible to create such a fake report. If that is possible, make such a report. \n",
