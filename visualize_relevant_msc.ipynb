    "## 4. Visualizing the most relevant MSc degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Using maps can help people understand how far one university is from another so they can plan their academic careers more adequately. Here, we challenge you to show a map of the courses found with the score defined in point 3. You should be able to identify at least the *city* and *country* for each MSc degree. You can find some ideas on how to create maps in Python [here](https://plotly.com/python/maps/) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python-e070374fe621) but you will maybe need further information for a proper visualization, like coordinates (latitude and longitude). You can retrieve this data using various tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Here](https://medium.com/@manilwagle/geocoding-the-world-using-google-api-and-python-1f6b6fb6ca48) you can find a helpful tutorial on how to encode geo-informations using Google API in Python (this tool can also be used in [Google Sheets](https://handsondataviz.org/geocode.html))\n",
    "2. You can collect a list of unique places in the format (City, Country) and ask chatGPT (or, as usual, any other LLM chatbot) to provide you with a list of corresponding representative coordinates\n",
    "3. Explore and find the best solution for your case!\n",
    "   \n",
    "Once you defined your visualization strategy, include a way to encode fees in your charts. The map should show (with a proper legend) different courses and associated taxation: the user wants a glimpse not only of how far he will need to move but also of how much it will cost him!\n"
